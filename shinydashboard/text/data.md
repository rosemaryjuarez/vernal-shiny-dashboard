#### **This page covers two dashboards:**

 -  **Vernal Map dashboard**
 -  **Data Visualizer dashboard**

Our map dashboard provides key information about each vernal pool, including:

-  Pool Depth (cm)
-  Pool Area (m²)
-  Pool Circumference (ft)
-  Site Area (m²)
-  Month and Year of data collection


Our data Vizualizer Dashboard provides:
- **Location-Pool ID Selection:**
  - Users can select a specific vernal pool location using a unique identifier.

- **Water Year Selection:**
    - Users can choose a specific water year for analysis.

- **Species Selection:**
    - There's an option to select individual plant species for detailed analysis.


 **Plot Types:**

Users can generate various types of plots:
1.  Water Level: Shows changes in water level over time.
2.  Species Abundance: Displays the abundance of different species.
3.  Native Cover: Shows the coverage of native plant species.
4.  Non-Native Cover: Shows the coverage of non-native plant species.
5.  Species Cover: Displays coverage for a specific selected species.


**Data Sources:**

The visualizations draw from two main data sources:
a. Hydro data: Contains information about water levels.
b. Percent cover data: Contains information about plant species coverage.
Time-based Analysis:

The water level plot allows for analysis by water year and date.
Species abundance and cover plots likely show data for selected time periods.


**Spatial Analysis:**

The species cover plots show data in relation to transect distance, allowing for spatial analysis within each pool.


**Interactive Plots:**

The use of Plotly suggests that these visualizations are interactive, allowing users to hover, zoom, and possibly select data points for more information.
