Background on Vernal Pools

Vernal pools are unique seasonal wetlands that form in shallow depressions during wet periods and dry out completely in warmer months.These ecosystems play a crucial role in supporting specialized plant and animal species that have adapted to their cyclical nature. There are three distinct phases: a wet phase when the pool fills with rainwater, an aquatic phase supporting various aquatic organisms, and a dry phase when the pool dries out. Vernal pools are sensitive to changes in the environment, making them useful for studying local plant and animal life, and how the climate is changing. Their unique features and the special creatures living in them make vernal pools important to study and protect.
