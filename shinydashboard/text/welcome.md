## Information and Data Visualization of Vernal Pools managed by UCSB's Cheadle Center for Biodiversity & Ecological Restoration.



Welcome to the Santa Barbara Vernal Pool dashboard. The purpose of this dashboard is to provide an interactive map of Vernal pools within the Santa Barbara region, and provide general characteristics on each pool. Additionally, each pool also provides data visualization and statistics. 


### Background


The Vernal pools in the Santa Barbara Region emcompasses approximately 70 Vernal Pools. These Pools are mostly located in the Goleta area, West from UC Santa Barbara Campus. One other Vernal pool is located in the Mesa area between Goleta and Santa Barbara. The range of information provided by each vernal pool consists of:

  - Pool Depth (cm)
  - Pool Area (m)
  - Pool Circumference(ft)
  - Site Area(m)
  - month and year
  
Month and year are of high interest, as there are three phases for vernal pools. However our data only fully covers the year 2019 and a portion of 2020.
