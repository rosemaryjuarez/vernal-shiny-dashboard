## Information and Data Visualization of Vernal Pools managed by UCSB's Cheadle Center for Biodiversity & Ecological Restoration.



Welcome to the Santa Barbara Vernal Pool dashboard. The purpose of this dashboard is to provide an interactive map of Vernal pools within the Santa Barbara region, and provide general characteristics on each pool. Additionally, each pool also provides data visualization and statistics. All primary research and efforts come from Joanna Tang and managed by UCSB's Cheadle Center for Biodiversity & Ecological Restoration.
